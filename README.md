 + Font Selection

    I had chosen a universal font to be used across the whole of the website as this made styling easy and had fit in well with the theme of my website. The Font I had chosen was Noto Sans

+ Colour Choice

    When considering the colour theme of my project I had to choose a theme that combined colours effortlessly with header image and ensure that there would be no confusion. The Images and text colour had contrasted the theme of the logo and website well, so I had chosen a mix of colours which include; Black, White, Grey and a shade of yellow as seen below.
