### 5. Surface
* Colors

When considering the colour theme of my project I had to choose a theme that combined colours effortlessly with header image and ensure that there would be no confusion. The Images and text colour had contrasted the theme of the logo and website well.

* Font Selection
 
I had chosen two complementary fonts with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to be used across the whole of the website. The chosen fonts were Roboto (for headers) and Open Sans (for paragraphs).
