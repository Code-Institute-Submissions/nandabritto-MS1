# Covid-19 vaccines

The intention of this project is explaining people around the world how vaccines work in our body, their importance in World’s Health and the main differences between the Covid-19 vaccine’s types. 
There are also a section showing why the covid-19 vaccine was rolled out faster than other vaccines in history and why we shall trust them.

## UX

### User Stories

+ As a user, I want to…

1.	be able to navigate the site easily.
2.	be able to understand why is important to get vaccinated.
3.	be able to understand how vaccines work on my body.
4.	be able to understand how vaccine is developed.
5.	understand how the Covid-19 vaccine was developed faster than other vaccines before.
6.	be able to understand the Covid-19 vaccine’s mechanism of action.
7.	be aware of the efficacy of the most used Covid-19 vaccines around world.
8.	be able to share this information by email and social networks.

+ As a site owner, I want…

1.	the information to be clear and informative.
2.	the information could help to prevent fake news about Covid-19 vaccines.
3.	the content encourages people to get vaccinated against the Covid-19 virus.
4.	the website be easy to navigate.

### 1. Strategy 

 * Project Purpose
    * To promote information about different types of Covid-19 vaccines;
    * 	To educate people about the dangers of not getting vaccinated against Covid-19.
    * 	To inform people in different countries how vaccination could be the only way to the world fight against this pandemic.
    * 	To inform that faster development of Covid-19 vaccine is not a problem on vaccine’s reliability.

### 2. Scope

 * I wanted a simple, straightforward UX experience.
 * I wanted my content to be clear. 
 * A site that is visually appealing on all devices.
 * Information about:
     *  how vaccines works;
     *  how the vaccine is produced;
     *  differences between Covid-19 vaccines in use;
     *  efficacy information about Covid-19 vaccines;
 * Ways to share vaccines information to avoid fake news.

### 3. Structure
*	A clear layout is in place to ensure users can immediately find all the information.
*	The navbar is sticky to facilitate user to navigate through pages easily.	The content is laid out in a way that makes it easy to read and the sections are clearly distinguished.
*	The Index page displays the most information regarding how vaccines work on the human immune system and how they are developed. It's broken down into small paragraphs making the content easy to read for the user.
*	The Types page effectively explain the mainly 3 different vaccines mechanism of action.

*	In the Footer, users can easily find share buttons to social media and email.

### 4. Skeleton

Wireframes created with Balsamiq. The project was developed from initial wireframes and some modifications were made during the development process to assure better usability. 

* Wireframes can be fond on the links.

### 5. Surface
* Colours

When considering the colour theme of my project I had to choose a theme that combined colours effortlessly with the header image and ensure that there would be no confusion. The Images and text colour had contrasted the theme of the logo and website well.

* Font Selection
 
I had chosen two complementary fonts with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to be used across the whole of the website. The chosen fonts were Roboto (for headers) and Open Sans (for paragraphs).

## Features 

+ Callout image/logo - Depositphotos photo was used to call user attention to the website subject.
<img src="https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/eff4eb18f4495e61609198a76d83896ecd1dea4a/header.png">

+ Navigation Bar 
Allows users to easily navigate the site and to visit all the information.

<img src="https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/eff4eb18f4495e61609198a76d83896ecd1dea4a/navbar%20(2).png">

The navbar has a sticky feature, so user can easily access any part of the website anytime.

+ Importance page

Divided into four sub-items, the user can navigate and get informed about:

   1. How are vaccines help our body fighting against diseases;  
   
   <img src="https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/eff4eb18f4495e61609198a76d83896ecd1dea4a/why.png">
   
   2. How they are developed;

A youtube video was used to make this abstract scientific content more understandable for all people. The user can watch the video on full screen and have all the controls available. 

   3. The importance of getting vaccinated for world health;
