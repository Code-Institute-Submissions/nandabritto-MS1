        <h1>Why is so important to get vaccinated?</h1>

        <hr>

        <p>When a sufficiently large percentage of a population has been vaccinated, herd immunity results. Herd
            immunity
            protects those who may be immunocompromised and cannot get a vaccine because even a weakened version
            would
            harm
            them. The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified.</p>

                <p>To understand how vaccines work, it helps to first look at how the body fights illness. </p>
                <p>Check on this video how our body fights infection and how vaccines can help our immunity system
                    to
                    fight easily the intruder. </p>

        <h2>What are the steps taken by scientists to develop this vaccine? </h2>

        <hr>

        <p>SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the coronavirus family. There are hundreds of coronaviruses — including four
            that
            can cause the
            common cold, as well as the coronaviruses that sparked the SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome,
            epidemic in 2002 and the emergence of MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, in 2012.</p>
        <p>Although vaccines against coronaviruses have yet been licensed for use in humans their development had
            previously been considered and research were made.</p>
        <p>After the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, vaccines against SARS-CoV were developed preclinically and two were
            tested
            in phase I trials. However, development was stopped because the virus was eradicated from the human
            population and has not re-emerged since 2004. Vaccines against MERS-CoV are currently under active
            development. </p>

            <img id="vaccine-production-squeme" src="images/41586_2020_2798_Fig1_HTML.jpg"
                alt="descriptive squeme comparing regular vaccine development and sars-covid-2 vaccine development"></a>

        <p>Traditional vaccine development can take 15 years or more, starting with a lengthy discovery phase in
            which
            vaccines are designed and exploratory preclinical experiments are conducted. This is usually followed by
            a
            phase in which more formal preclinical experiments and toxicology studies are performed and in which
            production processes are developed. </p>
        <p>During this process an investigational new drug (IND) application is filed and the vaccine candidate then
            enters phase I, II and III trials.</p>
        <p>If, when phase III trials are completed, the predetermined end points have been met, a biologics licence
            application (BLA) is filed, reviewed by regulatory agencies and finally the vaccine is licensed. </p>
        <p>After that point, large-scale production begins. </p>

        <h2>Why so faster?</h2>

        <hr>

        <p>Because of knowledge gained from the initial development of vaccines for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the
            discovery phase was omitted. </p>
        <p>Existing processes were adopted, and phase I/II trials were started. Phase III trials were initiated
            after the interim analysis of phase I/II results, with several clinical trial stages running in parallel.
        </p>
        <p>In the meantime, vaccine producers have started the large-scale production of several vaccine candidates
            and submitted regulatory review and on 2 December, a vaccine made by drug giant Pfizer with German biotech
            firm BioNTech, became the first fully-tested immunization to be approved for emergency use. After this,
            other
            vaccines were filled and their use were approved too. </p>
