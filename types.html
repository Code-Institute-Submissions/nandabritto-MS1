                <p>mRNA vaccines teach your body how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response, without
                    using a
                    live virus. After you get an mRNA vaccine, your body makes antibodies that help fight the infection
                    if a
                    virus enters your body in the future.</p>

                <p>The surface of the virus that causes COVID-19 is studded with proteins known as "spike proteins". The
                    virus uses these spikes to enter human cells, infecting you with COVID-19. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines
                    contain the
                    instructions for making this spike protein.
                </p>
                <p>After you get your vaccine, your immune system recognises that the protein doesn't belong there. Your
                    body then begins building an immune response to fight off what it thinks is an infection. This
                    immune
                    response makes antibodies.
                </p>
                <p>The antibodies offer you protection from COVID-19. It is much safer for your immune system to learn
                    how
                    to protect you from COVID-19 through vaccination than by catching the virus.
                </p>
                <p>Your cells then break down the instructions for making the spike protein and gets rid of them from
                    your
                    body.

                <p>
                    Viral vector vaccines are like messengers. They use a weakened version of a different virus (the
                    vector)
                    to deliver instructions to cells in your body.</p>
                <p> COVID-19 vaccines use the adenovirus as the vector.
                    Adenovirus is the virus that causes the common cold.

                    The virus uses these spikes to enter human cells, infecting you with COVID-19.
                </p>

                <p>When you get a viral vector vaccine, the vector (adenovirus) enters a cell in your body. It then
                    teaches the cell how to produce the COVID-19 spike protein.

                    After you get your vaccine, your immune system recognises that the protein doesn't belong there.
                    Your body then begins building an immune response to fight off what it thinks is an infection. This
                    immune response makes antibodies. </p>

                    alt="detailed squeme explaining how inactivated virus vaccine is produced">
                <p>Vaccines that make use of the entire pathogenic virus are called whole virus vaccines.</p>

                <p>Using a pathogen or a part of a pathogen in a vaccine is a traditional approach, and most vaccines
                    available today work this way.
                    There are two different types of whole virus vaccines: live attenuated and inactivated.</p>
                <p>Live attenuated vaccines use a weakened form of a pathogen. These elicit strong immune responses but
                    are not suitable for people with a weakened immune system.
                    In an inactivated vaccine, the pathogen is killed or modified in such a way that it is unable to
                    replicate. It cannot cause disease and is, therefore, suitable for those with a compromised immune
                    system.
                </p>
                <p>The inactivation step usually involves heat, radiation, or chemicals to destroy the pathogenâ€™s
                    genetic material, which stops it from replicating.
                    Inactivated vaccines can trigger a strong immune reaction, but it is usually not as strong as the
                    reaction that live attenuated vaccines can produce. Due to this, a person may need booster shots to
                    ensure ongoing protection.
