              A paragraph of placeholder text. We're using it here to show the use of the clearfix class. We're adding quite a few meaningless phrases here to demonstrate how the columns interact here with the floated image.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              As you can see the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated image. Now imagine how this would look with some actual content in here, rather than just this boring placeholder text that goes on and on, but actually conveys no tangible information at. It simply takes up space and should not really be read.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              And yet, here you are, still persevering in reading this placeholder text, hoping for some more insights, or some hidden easter egg of content. A joke, perhaps. Unfortunately, there's none of that here.
            </p>
                 <p>mRNA vaccines teach your body how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response, without using a
            live virus. After you get an mRNA vaccine, your body makes antibodies that help fight the infection if a
            virus enters your body in the future.</p>
        <p>The surface of the virus that causes COVID-19 is studded with proteins known as "spike proteins". The virus
            uses these spikes to enter human cells, infecting you with COVID-19. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines contain the
            instructions for making this spike protein.
        </p>
        <p>After you get your vaccine, your immune system recognises that the protein doesn't belong there. Your body
            then begins building an immune response to fight off what it thinks is an infection. This immune response
            makes antibodies.
        </p>
        <p>The antibodies offer you protection from COVID-19. It is much safer for your immune system to learn how to
            protect you from COVID-19 through vaccination than by catching the virus.
        </p>
        <p>
        Your cells then break down the instructions for making the spike protein and gets rid of them from your
            body.
