            <p>mRNA vaccines teach your body how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response, without using a
                live virus. After you get an mRNA vaccine, your body makes antibodies that help fight the infection if a
                virus enters your body in the future.</p>
                
            <p>The surface of the virus that causes COVID-19 is studded with proteins known as "spike proteins". The
                virus
                uses these spikes to enter human cells, infecting you with COVID-19. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines contain the
                instructions for making this spike protein.
            </p>
            <p>After you get your vaccine, your immune system recognises that the protein doesn't belong there. Your
                body
                then begins building an immune response to fight off what it thinks is an infection. This immune
                response
                makes antibodies.
            </p>
            <p>The antibodies offer you protection from COVID-19. It is much safer for your immune system to learn how
                to
                protect you from COVID-19 through vaccination than by catching the virus.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your cells then break down the instructions for making the spike protein and gets rid of them from your
                body.

            Viral vector vaccines are like messengers. They use a weakened version of a different virus (the vector)

        <p>COVID-19 vaccines use the adenovirus as the vector. Adenovirus is the virus that causes the common cold.

           <p>Vaccines that make use of the entire pathogenic virus are called whole virus vaccines. Using a pathogen or a part of a pathogen in a vaccine is a traditional approach, and most vaccines available today work this way. 
            There are two different types of whole virus vaccines: live attenuated and inactivated.
            </p>
            <p>Live attenuated vaccines use a weakened form of a pathogen. These elicit strong immune responses but are not suitable for people with a weakened immune system.
                In an inactivated vaccine, the pathogen is killed or modified in such a way that it is unable to replicate. It cannot cause disease and is, therefore, suitable for those with a compromised immune system. 
                </p>
                <p>The inactivation step usually involves heat, radiation, or chemicals to destroy the pathogenâ€™s genetic material, which stops it from replicating. 
                    Inactivated vaccines can trigger a strong immune reaction, but it is usually not as strong as the reaction that live attenuated vaccines can produce. Due to this, a person may need booster shots to ensure ongoing protection.
