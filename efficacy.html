            <h2 class="title">How effective are COVID-19 vaccines?</h2>
            <div id="comparation">

                <p>Johnson & Johnson's vaccine is being developed by its subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals and the
                    single-dose jab was shown to be 66% effective in global trials. Interestingly, that figure
                    was actually higher in its U.S. trials where it reached 72%.</p>

                <a data-lightbox="image-1" href="images/comparation-chart.jpeg">
                    <img class="responsive-squeme col-md-6 float-left " src="images/comparation-chart.jpeg"
                        alt="Comparation chart about covid-19 different vaccines"></a>


                <p>
                    The University of Oxford and pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca vaccine released initial data from
                    trials in late November, it showed that was 70.4 percent effective, though it can achieve up to 90%
                    protection if a half dose is taken initially, followed by a full dose.
                    The positive results came after Pfizer and BioNTech reported that their vaccine is 95%
                    effective at preventing Covid-19 while Moderna announced that their jab also has 95%
                    efficacy.</p>

                <p>
                    The Oxford University/AstraZeneca despite the positive results, there is no data regarding whether
                    the candidates prevent the coronavirus from being transmitted as well as for how long protection
                    lasts.</p>
                <p>
                    Even though it has a lower efficacy from a single dose, the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has been
                    shown to work effectively in different age groups, though Germany has prohibited it for over 65s,
                    citing a lack of data.</p>
                <p>
                    It is also significantly cheaper than other Covid-19 vaccines and much easier to store, meaning it
                    can be distributed more easily, potentially making it the shot of choice in poorer parts of the
                    world.</p>
                <p>
                    Its ease of storage characteristics are shared with Johnson & Johnson's shot which can last months
                    in a regular refrigerator while its single dose provides it with a further advantage over the
                    competition. </p>
                <p>
                    The Moderna vaccine can be stored at temperatures of between 2oC and 8oC for 30 days while the
                    Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, on the other hand, must be stored at -80oC, exacerbating logistical
                    challenges.</p>
                <p>
                    It is also important to mention the efforts of other countries, particularly Russia and its Sputnik
                    V, which is being developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology.
                    The Russian Health Ministry announced that Sputnik V is 92% effective, though that figure was
                    controversial as it was approved for distribution despite being tested in a small group of people.
                    According to late stage trial data published in The Lancet involving some 20,000 people, Sputnik V
                    is completely safe and is one of the world's most capable Covid-19 vaccines with an efficacy of 91.6
                    percent, closely matching those controversial initial estimates.</p>
                <p>
                    Elsewhere, China's Sinovac Biotech vaccine Coronavac has shown efficacy of 50% in Brazilian trials.
